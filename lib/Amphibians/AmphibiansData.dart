      "The bleeding toad, fire toad, or Indonesia tree toad (Leptophryne cruentata) is a species of \"true toad\", family Bufonidae, endemic to Java, Indonesia. Leptophryne javanica was included in this species prior its description as a distinct species in 2018, although the degree of differentiation between these species is low. Bleeding toad is listed as a critically endangered species due to a drastic population decline. The reasons of this decline are unclear, but the decline is consistent with chytridiomycosis, despite ambiguous identification.\n\nBleeding toads are medium-sized toads that have dark red/purple bodies with blood-red to yellow marbling present on the back and legs. Males measure 20–30 mm (0.79–1.18 in) and females 25–40 mm (0.98–1.57 in) in snout–vent length. They resemble other toads in the family Bufonidae with several distinctions. They have reduced Bidder's organs, and partially fused pectoral epicoracoid cartilage. In addition, they have a slender habitus and elongate limbs. They received the common name \"bleeding toad\" due to the red back markings and the skin secretions they produce when stressed.",
      habitat: "Bleeding toads are endemic to western Java and are known from a small number of sites in the Mount Gede Pangrango National Park and from around Mount Halimun Salak National Park. They prefer the boundary zones between the moist lowland areas and mountainous forests, and are at present typically found between altitudes of 1,200–2,000 m (3,900–6,600 ft) above sea level. They breed and lay their eggs in slow moving, vernal streams in which the larvae develop",
      diet: "Like most toads, the Bleeding toads eat small insects and other arthoropods.",

      "Nyctixalus pictus, also known as cinnamon frog, cinnamon treefrog, cinnamon bush frog, painted Indonesian treefrog, and white-spotted treefrog, etc., is a species of frog in the family Rhacophoridae. It is found in the Malay Peninsula (including southernmost Thailand), the Philippines, and parts of the Greater Sunda Islands (northern Borneo and northern Sumatra). Nyctixalus pictus grows to about 35 mm (1.4 in) in snout–vent length; males are slightly smaller than females. The snout is obtusely pointed. The tympanum is distinct. The limbs are long and the finger and toe tips are dilated into large discs. The fingers have no webbing whereas the toes are partly webbed. Coloration is brown or reddish brown with white to yellow spots on the body.\nThe Spotted Tree Frog, also known as White-spotted Tree Frog, Peter's Tree Frog or  Cinnamon Bush Frog, inhabits primary forest and disturbed secondary forest, from sea level up to at least 700 metres elevation. It is nocturnal in habits, frequenting low vegetation where it waits for insects and other prey to pass. Its eggs are laid in water-filled tree hollows, or phytothelms, where the young tadpoles are able to develop in relative safety. The dorsal colour of this frog is unmistakable: it is generally bright orange, but sometimes brown or yellowish-brown, and is flecked with tiny white spots. The ventral surface is pale. Its eyes are moderate in size, and the iris is pale above and bronze below. Its fingers and toes are long and unwebbed, with the tips expanded into small disks. Its call comprises a quiet series of 'peeps', which can easily be mistaken as that of an insect.",
      habitat: "This species can be found in Sumatra (Indonesia), Borneo. Nyctixalus pictus occurs in the shrub and lower tree layers of primary and secondary forests at elevations below 700 m (2,300 ft) (up to 1,650 m (5,410 ft) in Borneo). The tadpoles develop in arboreal water-filled cavities (including phytotelms) and in rotting logs. Nyctixalus pictus is widespread but uncommon. Populations are threatened by habitat loss due to clearing of forests for agriculture and logging. Its range includes several protected areas.",
      diet: "Nocturnal, arboreal, feeds on insects. Often found in low vegetation of primary forests.",

      "Ansonia leptopus or commonly known as the Brown Slender Toad is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae. It is known from a few lowland localities in Borneo (including Brunei), Sumatra (Indonesia). It is reported as common in lowland Malaysian Borneo. Its common names are brown slender toad, Matang stream toad, and cricket-voiced toad. Males measure 30–40 mm (1.2–1.6 in) and females to 55 mm (2.2 in) in snout–vent length. There are low warts on the dorsum and brown or yellow spines under the mandible. Males have dark brown nuptial pads. The tadpoles are small (<20 mm (0.79 in)) and have unusual black markings on a light background. Compared to other Ansonia tadpoles, the oral sucker is less well-developed.\n\nAnsonia leptopus is a common lowland stream toad. The individuals depicted on this page are from West Sarawak. Calling males sit on boulders and rocks on river banks at night. Adult males are 30–40 mm in snout-vent length, females are up to 65 mm. This species may be confused with Ansonia longidigita, which is a comparably large species often found in the same places. Ansonia leptopus has low warts on its back and brown or yellow spines under the mandible. The nuptial pads in males are dark brown.\n Ansonia leptopus tadpoles are very distinct. Black markings on a light background make the tadpole of this species unique. Only Ansonia longidigita larvae are to some degree similar.\n\nTadpoles are small (< 20 mm). They are associated with submerged vegetation or leaf litter, and on rocks in stream sections with slow current. The oral sucker is less well-developed than in other Ansonia larvae.",
      habitat: "The species' natural habitat is primary rainforest. Adults occur widely dispersed on the forest floor and herb stratum. Calling males can be found sitting on boulders and rocks on river banks at night. Breeding is explosive and takes place in small, clear, rocky-bottomed streams. The tadpoles are most common in shallow side pools and in submerged beds of dead leaves. It is threatened by habitat loss through deforestation, which also causes siltation of the streams.",

      "Ansonia minuta is a species of toad in the family Bufonidae, described from the forests of Sarawak in 1960. It is known by a number of common names: tiny stream toad, dwarf slender toad, and minute slender toad. It is endemic to Borneo (both Indonesia and Malaysia) and occurs in tropical moist lowland forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.\nRecent phylogenetic studies found that A. minuta forms a sister relationship with another as yet undescribed member of Ansonia, and is positioned in a clade consisting of Ansonia hanitschi, Ansonia spinulifer, Ansonia platysoma, and the undescribed species.\nA. minuta is a smaller member of the genus Ansonia. Males range up between 20–24 mm (0.79–0.94 in) while the females measure up to 30 mm (1.2 in) in snout–vent length. The species is slender, with a wide truncate snout. Ear tympani are visible; the feet have rudimentary webbing. The skin on the back is tuberculate with rounded warts, while flanks and throat are more finely granulated. The male possesses a vocal sac with a longitudinal slit on the left side of the mouth. Larvae are recorded to grow up to 17.2 mm (0.68 in).\nA. minuta is currently listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN, as it is believed to suffer from habitat loss through logging and the species will not inhabit disturbed habitats.\nAdult males up to 23 mm snout-vent length, females 23–28 mm. This species has a sharp tarsal ridge, present otherwise only in A. albomarginata. Calling males sit on saplings close to streams. Ansonia minuta tadpoles grow up to 25 mm. They possess the typical large oral sucker and tear-drop body shape that characterize tadpoles of the genus Ansonia. The body is streamlined, depressed. The tail fins are low and restricted to the distal half of the tail. Coloration is dark brown to black on dorsum.",
      habitat: "The species is endemic to Borneo and known from western and adjacent western Kalimantan (Indonesia) between elevations of 200–1,000 m (660–3,280 ft) above sea level.

      description:
      "The Bornean flat-headed frog (Barbourula kalimantanensis) is a species of frog in the family Bombinatoridae.The Bornean flat-headed frog is one of only two species in its genus, and its sister species is found in the Philippines. Together, these two frogs diverged from all other living amphibians around 65 million years ago. That is around the same time that dinosaurs went extinct!. Although many salamanders are lungless, the Bornean flat-headed frog is the first frog known to have no lungs.\nDjoko Iskandar, an Indonesian zoologist, first described the Bornean flat-headed frog based on a single specimen. However, he did not know the frog was lungless until he was in the field with David Bickford's expedition. Bickford et al. were able to dissect some of the specimens and discovered for the first time that the frogs had no lungs. The frog breathes entirely through its skin, and its internal organs (the stomach, spleen and the liver) take up much of the space which normally would be filled by the lungs. By retaining the lunglessness of their tadpole stage, the frogs are much flatter than typical frogs, which might help absorb oxygen and avoid being swept away in fast streams.\nThis frog grows to a snout-to-vent length of 77 mm (3.0 in) for females and males are slightly smaller. It has a dorsoventrally flattened body with a broad head with a rounded snout. The limbs are robust and both hands and feet are fully webbed. The dorsal skin is smooth with small tubercles on the posterior end and the hind legs and the ventral skin is smooth. Its general colour is brown with black mottling.\nThe Bornean flat-headed frog is listed as Endangered by the IUCN. It is threatened by habitat loss from severe degradation of the river habitats because of increased turbidity and toxic metals used in mining and other negative consequences of development on the island.\n\nBarbourula kalimantanensis is the only known lungless frog (Bickford et al. 2008). This species is a medium-sized frog (males to 66 mm SVL, females to 77.7 mm SVL), characterized by a distinct broad, extremely flattened, depressed head, rounded snout, and a stocky, depressed body (Iskandar 1978; Iskandar 1995). The nostrils of this frog are located at the end of the snout and are flush with the skin. There is no canthus rostralis and no lores. Eyes are located anterolaterally on the head, with a free nasolacrimal papilla positioned just below the lower eyelid. The tympanic annulus is lacking. Both the maxilla and premaxilla of B. kalimantanensis are toothed, with two partitioned rows behind the choanae. Vomerine teeth of this frog species resemble a pair of tubercles and are situated on the roof of the mouth just posterior to the choanae. The tongue is circular (Iskandar 1978; Iskandar 1995). No glottis (protected opening to the airway) is present, unlike any other known frog species, and the esophageal opening leads directly to the stomach (Bickford et al. 2008). Males lack vocal sacs (Iskandar 1978; Iskandar 1995). The arms and legs are stout, with fully webbed hands and feet. The hands and feet are unusual in that they resemble paddles, with the second and third fingers being roughly equal and the third and fourth toes also. Fingertips of B. kalimantanensis are distinctively enlarged into discs, but lack a circummarginal groove. Three low metacarpal tubercles are present on the hand, but the hand lacks any subarticular tubercles. Toe discs are enlarged as a series, with the first toe disc being the largest. A thick ridge of skin is present along the median edge of the first toe. The foot of B. kalimantanensis has an inner metatarsal tubercle but lacks an outer metatarsal tubercle. There is a fold of skin along the rear of the thigh as well as one along the tibia. Female B. kalimantanensis are distinguishable by the appearance of triangular muscle projections on either side of their cloaca, known as anal claspers. Dorsally, the skin texture of B. kalimantanensis is rugose (wrinkly and creased), with small projecting tubercles or spinules located on the posterior portion of the dorsum and on the hindlimbs. Ventrally, the skin is smooth (Iskandar 1978; Iskandar 1995). Specimens preserved in alcohol are uniformly black in dorsal coloration; the ventral coloration is dark with indistinct lighter marbling (brown mottling in the single preserved male specimen and yellow mottling in the single preserved female specimen)",
      habitat: "This aquatic frog lives in cold, clear, and fast rivers in remote areas of the rain forests of Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo. It is known from only two localities, both in the Kapuas River basin.\n Barboroula kalimantanensis occurs in the Kapuas River Basin, West Kalimantan, and in central Kalimantan, Indonesia (Borneo). This species is primarily aquatic and is found in clear, cold (14-17 degrees C), swift (2-5 m/sec), shallow freshwater rivers, 20-50 m wide, within primary rainforest.

      "Limnonectes larvaepartus is a species of fanged frog in the family Dicroglossidae endemic to northern and western Sulawesi, Indonesia. It is unique in that it has internal fertilization and gives live birth to tadpoles. Other frog species that have live birth produce froglets.\nThe frog was first mentioned in 1994 under the nomen nudum \"Limnonectes ovovivipar\", which refers to ovovivipary, whereby the tadpoles hatch from their eggs while still inside their mother. In 2014, it was formally named and described by Djoko Iskandar, Ben Evans, and Jim McGuire. Its specific name is derived from larvae + Latin partus (give birth). The authors collected over 100 specimens for their study and witnessed either direct birth of tadpoles or tadpoles in the oviducts on 19 occasions. They also observed free-living tadpoles in stream-side puddles.\nIn 2015, the International Institute for Species Exploration names it as one of the \"Top 10 New Species\" for new species discovered in 2014.\nThe average male size (from tip of snout to cloaca) is 37.4 millimetres (1+15⁄32 inches), while the average female size is 40.2 mm (1+19⁄32 in). Within Sulawesi, it has been found in the Northern Peninsula and on the western edge of the central core. The dorsum is typically brownish-grey, but can also be reddish-brown or golden-tan. The underside may be yellowish or cream, with a dark spot often marking the upper end of the tibia. Females produce approximately 100 eggs, which hatch as tadpoles in the oviducts and are probably retained there until exhausting their supply of yolk. Apart from yolk, the oviductal tadpoles may also feed on feces and dead siblings. The tadpoles are birthed into slow-moving streams. They feature well-developed tails, mouthparts and pigmentation at birth. After birth, tadpoles likely self-feed even before metamorphosis into froglets. The oviducts have no obvious specializations to accommodate the tadpoles, raising the possibility that the unique breeding mode is the result of a simple behavioral change in fertilization method. It is not known how internal fertilization occurs, as the male frog has no obvious intromittent organ.\n\nUnlike other frogs, Limnonectes larvaepartus from Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, gives birth to tadpoles that are deposited in pools of water. On one occasion, a female gave birth to a tadpole in the hand of a scientist at the moment she was captured. Fewer than a dozen of the world’s 6,455 frog species have internal fertilization and all except this new species lay fertilized eggs or give birth to tiny froglets. The species, about 1.5 inches long (40mm), is found in the island’s Northern Peninsula on the western edge of the Central Core. The region has not been fully explored for frogs, so the extent of this species’ range is not yet known.",
      habitat: "This species is known to occur from the Minahassa Peninsula in the north to the western edge of the Central Core on Sulawesi Island. It is unknown if it also occurs within the Central Core, as the mountainous terrain of that region has made it difficult to conduct surveys. This species is found in both natural and disturbed forests in Sulawesi, and tends to be in sympatry with other Limnonectes species. Its preferred habitat is on rocks, leaves, or other vegetation at least a few meters away from fast-flowing streams",

      "This species is a large frog ranging from 100–120 mm in length. They are light to dark brown on the dorsal surface with varying patterns and camouflage very well with the forest floor. The throat is black-dark brown and diffuses into cream-yellow halfway along the ventral surface. The upper eyelids and snout are drawn out into long triangular projections, forming what looks like \"horns\", giving them their common name. There are two pairs of dorsolateral skin folds running down this species back. One pair starts behind the eye and ends near the groin, the other pair starts at corner of the eye and ends roughly halfway between the armpit and groin. The dorsum has randomly scattered, enlarged tubercles. Arms and legs are barred with skin folds and are mottled cream and different shades of brown. The toes are slightly webbed and the fingers are free from webbing. The tympanum is indistinct and the iris is golden brown.",
      habitat: "The long nosed horned frog can be widely found in Sumatra, Borneo and even kalimantan. This species lives in permanently damp and cool lowland and submontane rainforests among leaf litter. The call is a loud, resonating, metallic \"honk\" or \"henk\". Breeding takes place in streams, female frogs attach the eggs to the underside of partially or full submerged rocks or logs. The capsules are large and few in number. This species may lie still on the forest floor waiting for an unsuspecting prey item to pass by, they then lash out and engulf the prey. They typically feed on spiders, small rodents, lizards and other frogs.",

The dorsum has randomly scattered, enlarged tubercles. Arms and legs are barred with skin folds and are mottled cream and different shades of brown. The toes are slightly webbed and the fingers are free from webbing. The tympanum is indistinct and the iris is golden brown.\nBufo biporcatus has a moderately-sized but stout body. The females of this species are typically larger than the males. The females have a snout-vent length of 60-80 mm, while males have a snout-vent length of 55-70 mm. Members of this species exhibit two elongated supraparietal ridges between the eyes; the species' name is derived from these ridges. Small and distinct parotoid glands are present. The skin is wrinkled and covered with tubercles. The tympanum is visible and may be circular or somewhat elliptical. Toes are half-webbed except for the fourth toe (Church, 1960a). Dorsal coloration is brown (may be a reddish or grayish shade), mottled with darker blotches. Male B. biporcatus generally have red throats. The color pattern is lighter in populations from east (Lombok) to west (Bali, Java) within the species range .The tadpoles are small, with the tail usually no longer than double the head plus body length, and a denticle formula of I+1-1/III. Papillae are confined to the corner of the mouth, and the mouth is not adapted for stream-dwelling",
      habitat: "This species is endemic to Indonesia and is found in Sumatra, Java, Madura, Bali, and Lombok, as well as having been introduced in Sulawesi. It occurs at lower elevation (up to 700 m) in both primary and secondary forest, as well as in areas of human habitation on Bali and Lombok. In Java it tends to be restricted to more forested regions.\nIts natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, rivers, plantations, rural gardens, and heavily degraded former forest. It is threatened by habitat loss.",
      diet: "The Crested toad typically feeds on small insects and other invertebrates.",
