      description:
      "The Komodo dragon, also known as the Komodo monitor, is a member of the monitor lizard family Varanidae that is endemic to the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang. It is the largest extant species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 metres, and weighing up to approximately 70 kilograms.\nAs a result of their size, Komodo dragons are apex predators, and dominate the ecosystems in which they live. Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds, and mammals. It has been claimed that they have a venomous bite; there are two glands in the lower jaw which secrete several toxic proteins. The biological significance of these proteins is disputed, but the glands have been shown to secrete an anticoagulant. Komodo dragons' group behavior in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world. The diet of Komodo dragons mainly consists of Javan rusa (Rusa timorensis), though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion. Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans.\n Mating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September; as many as 20 eggs are deposited at a time in an abandoned megapode nest or in a self-dug nesting hole. The eggs are incubated for seven to eight months, hatching in April, when insects are most plentiful. Young Komodo dragons are vulnerable and dwell in trees to avoid predators, such as cannibalistic adults. They take 8 to 9 years to mature and are estimated to live up to 30 years.\nKomodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910. Their large size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits. In the wild, their range has contracted due to human activities, and is likely to contract further from the effects of climate change; due to this, they are listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List. They are protected under Indonesian law, and Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to aid protection efforts.\n\nIn the wild, adult Komodo dragons usually weigh around 70 kg (150 lb), although captive specimens often weigh more. According to Guinness World Records, an average adult male will weigh 79 to 91 kg  and measure 2.59 m, while an average female will weigh 68 to 73 kg  and measure 2.29 m (7.5 ft). The largest verified wild specimen was 3.13 m (10.3 ft) long and weighed 166 kg, including its undigested food.",
      habitat: "Komodo dragons have thrived in the harsh climate of Indonesia's Lesser Sunda Islands for millions of years. They prefer the islands’ tropical forests but can be found across the islands. Though these athletic reptiles can walk up to seven miles per day, they prefer to stay close to home—rarely venturing far from the valleys in which they hatched.",
      diet: "As the dominant predators on the handful of islands they inhabit, Komodo dragons will eat almost anything, including carrion, deer, pigs, smaller dragons, and even large water buffalo. When hunting, Komodo dragons rely on camouflage and patience, lying in wait for passing prey. When a victim ambles by, the dragon springs, using its sharp claws, and serrated, shark-like teeth to eviscerate its prey.",

      "For a while considered a subspecies of Python curtus, P. breitensteini was re-elevated to a full species by Keogh, Barker and Shine (2001). The specific name, breitensteini, is in honor of Heinrich Breitenstein, a German physician and naturalist who collected amphibians and reptiles in Borneo.\nAdults of P. breitensteini have been reported to attain a total length (including tail) of 2.1 m (7 ft), although they are usually no more than 1.2 m (4 ft). Heavy-bodied, they can weigh as much as 13.6 kg (30 lb). Females are generally larger than males. The head is broad with several thermoreceptive pits along the nose. The tail is short and tapering. The color pattern is usually tan with brown blotching, which varies greatly. Though no instances of albinism have been reported, a few individuals display a significantly lighter color, appearing more yellow than brown. Juveniles have a more contrasting pattern than adults. The head is usually yellow.\nWhile the Borneo python generally has a reputation for being mean-tempered, this species is increasing in popularity among reptile enthusiasts because captive-bred specimens are recognized as easier to handle than wild-caught snakes. Almost all of the early imported animals were animals originally caught for the skin trade.",
      habitat: "On the island of Borneo, is found in Indonesia.Typically, it is found at lower elevations, on poorly drained flood plains, or on the edges of swampy areas; man-made irrigation of farmland has also provided appropriate habitat.",

      "The banded krait (Bungarus fasciatus) is a species of elapid snake that can be found in Java & Sumatra. It is the largest species of kraits, with a maximum length up to 2.7m\nThe banded krait is easily identified by its alternate black and yellow crossbands, its triangular body cross section, and the marked vertebral ridge consisting of enlarged vertebral shields along its body. The head is broad and depressed. The eyes are black. It has arrowhead-like yellow markings on its otherwise black head and has yellow lips, lores, chin, and throat. The longest banded krait measured was 2.25 m long, but normally the length encountered is 1.8 m.\nThe snake has an entire anal plate and single subcaudals. The tail is small, about one-tenth the length of the snake.\nThe scientific name of the genus is derived from the Kannada/Telugu word 'bangara' in Kannada and 'bangarum' in Telugu, meaning 'gold', referring to the yellow rings around its body.\n\nBanded kraits are shy, not typically seen, and are mainly nocturnal. When harassed, they will usually hide their heads under their coils, and do not generally attempt to bite, though at night they are much more active and widely considered to be more dangerous then. During the day, they lie up in grass, pits, or drains. The snakes are lethargic and sluggish even under provocation. They are most commonly seen in the rains\nThe venom of the banded krait mainly contains neurotoxins (pre- and postsynaptic neurotoxins) with LD50 values of 2.4 mg/kg 3.6 mg/kg SC, 1.289 mg/kg IV and 1.55 mg/kg IP. The quantity of venom delivered averages out at 20–114 mg. Engelmann and Obst list the venom yield at 114 mg (dry weight). The major clinical effects caused by the venom of this species include vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and dizziness. Severe envenomation can lead to respiratory failure and death may occur due to suffocation. Banded krait venom can damage the kidneys if injected.A clinical toxicology study gives an untreated mortality rate of 1–10%, which may be because contact with humans is rare and when bites do occur, the rate of envenomation when biting defensively is thought to be very low. Currently, polyvalent antivenoms are available in India and Indonesia.",
      habitat: "The banded krait occurs in the whole of the Indo-Chinese subregion, the Malay peninsula and Indonesian archipelago.\nBanded kraits may be seen in a variety of habitats, ranging from forests to agricultural lands. They inhabit termite mounds and rodent holes close to water, and often live near human settlement, especially villages, because of their supply of rodents and water. They prefer the open plains of the countryside. The banded krait has been found in Myanmar up to an altitude of 5000 feet.",
      diet: "The banded krait feeds mainly on other snakes, but is also known to eat fish, frogs, skinks, and snake eggs.\nThe prey is swallowed head first, after it has been rendered inactive by the venom",

The sole member of the genus Ophiophagus, it is distinguishable from other cobras, most noticeably by its size and neck patterns. The king cobra is the world's longest venomous snake, with an average length of 3.18 to 4 m, reaching a maximum of 5.85 m. Its skin colour varies across the habitats, from black with white stripes to unbroken brownish grey. It preys chiefly on other snakes, including its own species. Unlike other snakes, it rarely hunts non-reptile vertebrates, such as rodents and lizards.\nKing Cobra snake body length generally ranges from 3.18 to 4 meters. The longest specimen ever found was 5.85 meters long. Male snakes are larger than female snakes.\nThe upper body (dorsal) is olive, yellowish-brown, or grayish in color, with the head tending to be lighter in color. The lower part of the body (ventral) is gray or brown, with a yellowish neck area decorated with black spots. In young snakes, the body is darker or blackish in color, and is decorated with small white or yellowish stripes. Even so, the stripes are sometimes still visible as adults, although they are more subtle.\nThe head of the snake is large with a snout that tends to be short and blunt. Unlike other snakes in general, behind the pariental shield (scales) there is a pair of large occipital shields. There are 7 labial (lip) shields, some of which are in contact with the eyes. The pupils of the eyes are large and round. The dorsal scales consist of 15 rows in the middle of the body. The ventral scales are 215 to 262 pieces.

      "All types of this genus have a solid body but somewhat flattened. The body is mottled brown or gray and dark, except for Tiliqua nigrolutea and Tiliqua rugosa. As the name implies, these lizards have broad tongues and are dark blue or bluish black in color. This lizard will stick out its tongue if disturbed, with the intention that the intruder thinks that this lizard is poisonous and then leaves it. These lizards move quite slowly compared to other types of lizards. These lizards like insects, small arachnids, vegetables, and fruits as food. Almost all species are distributed in Australia, except for Tiliqua gigas which is only found in Maluku and Papua. These lizards reproduce by laying eggs in their stomachs and giving birth (Ovoviviparous). These lizards usually give birth to as many as 5-10 tails, the number of children of each species is different. The eggs will hatch in the stomach after incubation between 3 to 5 months. The length of the newly hatched young lizard reaches about 13 cm.\n Indonesian Blue Tongue Skinks are 15-30” long (38-76 centimeters) and weigh around 700 grams. They are typically smaller than Northerns. All blue-tongued skinks have long bodies, short, thick tails, short legs, triangular heads, and of course blue tongues. Tanimbars are silver, grey, or yellow in color, with hard and glossy scales. Classic Indonesians are distinguished by their green or yellowish coloring, solid black forelimbs, speckling between bands, and thin black head markings. Meraukes have a salmon or orange-colored belly, freckling on their arms, and distinct banding typically without freckling in between the bands. Irian Jayas have speckled forearms, brown banding, and minimal speckling in between the bands. Kei Island BTS have unique freckles from their head down their back.\nBlue-tongued skinks are fairly large lizards, reaching 18 to 20 inches in length. They have long, solid bodies, triangular-shaped heads and comparatively small legs. The tail is slightly shorter than the length of the body and tapers to a point. There are several species of blue-tongued skinks inhabiting Australia and Indonesia, which all differ slightly in appearance. Indonesian blue-tongued skinks vary in color among individuals but are generally grey or pale brown with irregular dark brown or black bands across the back and tail. Their legs are mostly black with small specks of white. They are also equipped with a blue tongue.\n\nUnlike most reptile species, these skinks do not lay eggs. Instead they are ovoviviparous, meaning they give birth to live young encased in membranous sacs. Mating occurs in the spring months. Gestation lasts three to four months and results in five to 15 young. Neonates are able to feed on their own after birth and are reared quickly.",
      habitat: "Indonesian blue-tongued skinks live in arid grasslands and dry sclerophyll forests. Their short legs do not allow them to climb easily, so they spend the vast majority of their time on the ground hiding in the brush or in shallow burrows carved by their shovel-like snouts. They are diurnal (active during the daytime) and they generally find cover to rest under at night. Even though skinks have very sturdy, solid tails, they can release them like some other lizard species. This is used as a defense mechanism when necessary. Their tails will heal over, sometimes growing back, but never reform exactly like the original. Blue-tongued skinks may also display their blue tongue when threatened.",
      diet: "Blue-tongued skinks are omnivorous, eating both animal and plant matter. In the wild, they eat fruit, insects, mollusks and carrion. At Happy Hollow, they are fed fruits, vegetables and insects.\n\nMost species are diurnal, ground-foraging omnivores, feeding on a wide variety of insects, gastropods, flowers, fruits and berries. The pygmy blue-tongue is again the exception, being primarily an ambush predator of terrestrial arthropods. All are viviparous, with litter sizes ranging from 1-4 in the pygmy blue-tongue and shingleback to 5-24 in the eastern and northern blue-tongues.",

The species is sexually dimorphic, the males being more brightly colored and slightly larger.\nTokay geckos are generally aggressive, territorial, and can inflict a strong bite. Females lay clutches of one or two hard-shelled eggs and guard them until they hatch. The tokay gecko feeds on insects, fruit, vegetation and small vertebrates. It is a strong climber with foot pads that can support the entire weight of the body on a vertical surface for a long period of time.

Generally, it is dark greenish-gray to almost black in background color, with bright gold-yellow or sometimes bluish spotting along its dorsal surface and a lighter straw-yellow color on its ventral side. It has a pointed snout, excellent eyesight and hearing, sharp teeth, and a prehensile tail that measures two-thirds of its total length. V. timorensis also has long, sharp claws well-suited for climbing and defense. The species grows to a maximum of 61 cm, and weighs between 100 and 350 g.\nKimberley rock monitors (Varanus glauerti), banded tree monitors (Varanus scalaris), and spotted tree monitors (Varanus similis) were once considered subspecies of the Timor monitor, but have since been elevated to full species status. Currently, the peacock monitor (Varanus auffenbergi) is sometimes considered a subspecies, but is usually considered its own species.\nTimor monitors are arboreal, diurnal lizards. Their diet consist of a variety of invertebrates and other lizards such as geckos. Breeding takes place from December to March, and clutches of up to 11 eggs are laid; the eggs incubate three to four months, depending on the average temperature. Hatchlings are about 5 in long, but grow quickly.\n\nFrequently bred in captivity, this monitor is also still imported in small numbers for the exotic pet trade. Wild-caught specimens can be nervous and difficult to handle, but captive-raised animals are much less shy. Its small size makes it an attractive choice for any varanid enthusiast, as they are easily housed in an enclosure oriented towards vertical climbing space (optimally a custom enclosure of 4'x2'x2', or larger for pairs and groups), ample hiding spots, a basking area between 120 and 150 °F, with ambient temperatures between 78 and 90 °F.

      description:
      "The earless monitor lizard was described in 1878 by Franz Steindachner. The genus name Lanthanotus means \"hidden ear\" and the species name borneensis refers to its home island of Borneo. The uniqueness of the species was recognized from the start and Steindachner placed it in its own family, Lanthanotidae. In 1899 George Albert Boulenger relegated it to the family Helodermatidae, together with the beaded lizards and gila monster. Further studies were conducted in the 1950s where it was found that although it is related to Helodermatidae, this relationship is relatively distant. The similarity is in part the result of convergent evolution and they should be recognized as separate families. Both are part of a broader Anguimorpha, but the relationship among the various families has been a matter of dispute. Several earlier studies have placed the earless monitor lizard together with Helodermatidae and Varanidae (true monitor lizards) in Varanoidea. More recent genetic evidence has found that the nearest relative of the earless monitor lizard is Varanidae. Most authorities continue to recognize them as separate families as the divergence between them is deep, but some have suggested that the earless monitor lizard should be included as a subfamily, Lanthanotinae, of the Varanidae. Together they form a clade and its sister group is Shinisauridae; at a higher level the sister groups of these three are Helodermatidae and others families in Anguimorpha. The most recent common ancestor diverged in the mid-Cretaceous.\n\nEarless monitor lizards have a cylindrical body, long neck, short limbs, long sharp claws, small eyes, semitransparent lower eyelids, and six longitudinal rows of strongly keeled scales. Despite the name, they are capable of hearing, although lack a tympanum, an ear opening and other externally visible signs of ears. The upperparts are orangish-brown, and the underside is mottled dark brown and whitish, pale yellowish, ochre or rusty. The tail is prehensile and if it is lost, it is not regenerated. The skin is shed infrequently, possibly less than once a year. There are both reports of the skin shedding in one piece (similar to snakes), or in smaller pierces (as typical of lizards). Overall the sexes are alike, but males have a distinctly broader head and broader tail base than females. The differences between the sexes are clearly noticeable from an age of about three years. They sometimes oscillate the throat (similar to frogs) and the forked tongue is sometimes flicked (similar to snakes). They can make a gentle, squeaky vocalization\nAdult earless monitor lizards typically have a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of about 20 cm (8 in), and a total length of about 40 cm (16 in). Eighteen wild individuals, six males and twelve females, ranged from 15.6 to 22 cm (6.1–8.7 in) in SVL, 17.4 to 22.1 cm (6.9–8.7 in) in tail length (disregarding one individual missing much of its tail), and 48 to 120 g (1.7–4.2 oz) in weight (disregarding one sickly and skinny individual). Among these, the largest total length (SVL+tail) was a male that measured 44.1 cm (17.4 in), which also is the longest recorded in the wild. A specimen collected in the 1960s has a total length of 51 cm (20 in), and near the time of its death an individual kept at the Bronx Zoo from 1968 to 1976 had a total length of 47 cm (18.5 in) and weighed 209 g (7.4 oz), but it was highly obese. When hatching the total length of the young is about 7–14 cm (3–6 in). When one year old, their total length is about 23–25 cm (9–10 in).\nEarless monitor lizards are generally strictly nocturnal animals, although exceptionally daytime observations in the open have been reported. The day is usually spent near water in burrows that can be up to 30 cm (1 ft) long or under logs, rocks or vegetation. They are generally quite inactive and not agile, but can make surprisingly fast spurts when startled, and will rapidly catch prey items placed in front of them. During one study where 19 individuals were located during the night, about half were in the water and the other half near water on land. In captivity they sometimes remain virtually immobile underwater for hours, periodically lifting the nose above the water's surface to breathe. When underwater, the semitransparent lower eyelids are generally closed, covering the eyes. It has been speculated that the prehensile tail is wrapped around stones, roots and other things underwater to avoid being swept along during floods.\nAlthough generally docile and inactive when handled, males are usually more aggressive than females when caught. In one case, a scientist received a deep bite in his finger, but did not experience any effects that could indicate a presence of venom in the bite (unlike the related and venomous beaded lizards, gila monster and some monitor lizards). This supported decades-old dissection studies where no venom glands or grooves in the teeth were found. Others kept in captivity were found to bite often, resulting in wounds that are relatively deep (compared to those from similar-sized lizards) and can bleed extensively, with blood clotting reputedly being slower than in normal wounds. Recent studies have found both venom glands, and toxic compounds in the bite of this species. The main components are kallikreins  with the primary effect being the cleaving of fibrinogen, which is important for blood clotting. However, this effect is quite weak in the venom of the earless monitor lizard compared to that of many other venomous reptiles, including some of the true monitor lizards.",
      habitat: "The earless monitor lizard is endemic to the Southeast Asian island of Borneo as well as West and North Kalimantan in Indonesia. Until late 2012, its known range in North Kalimantan was a part of East Kalimantan. It is not known from Brunei, but may occur there and has been recorded 100 km from the border. There are no records from Sabah, Central Kalimantan or South Kalimantan.It is found in lowlands at altitudes below 300 m (1,000 ft) near streams and marshes.These are typically in rainforests, but it is also found in streams flowing through degraded habitats such as agricultural land, mature fruit tree gardens and palm oil plantations, and reportedly may occur in rice paddies. The streams it inhabits are often rocky.Its habitat is tropical with air and water temperatures that generally are about 22–29 °C (72–84 °F), and captives reportedly prefer 24–28 °C (75–82 °F). At a site with a high density of earless monitor lizards the water was clear and had a neutral pH.\n\nThe earless monitor lizard has not been rated by the IUCN, but it likely qualifies for vulnerable (if its range covers less than 2,000 km2 or 770 sq mi) or endangered (if its range covers less than 500 km2 or 190 sq mi). The species is usually considered very rare, but it is easily overlooked and as recently as 1999 the only published confirmed records were from Sarawak. Confirmation from Kalimantan only appeared later. In some areas locals are unaware of its presence or consider it rare, but in others it may be common. At one site in West Kalimantan, 17 of 21 locals asked were aware of its presence and most of these considered it common. At three other sites in the region the majority asked were aware of its presence, but less than half considered it common. Elsewhere in West Kalimantan, a three-night survey of a 400 m (1,300 ft) long section of a stream, as well as two adjacent streams, located 19 earless monitor lizards, representing an unusually high density for a lizard of this size. Despite this high density in a stream used by locals for washing, fishing and as a source of drinking water, they only reported seeing the species very rarely and some had never seen it. Nevertheless, at present the earless monitor lizard is only known for certain from a relatively small number of sites.",
      diet: "They typically feed on earthworms, crustaceans and fish. In captivity, they will eat fish (both whole and pieces), earthworms, squid, shrimp, tadpoles, yolk from green sea turtle eggs, pieces of pig and chicken liver, baby mice and mussels, but refuse to take bird eggs and legs of frog. In captivity adults typically eat once or twice per week, but sometimes enter longer periods where they do not feed. Unusually for a lizard, they can swallow prey while submerged underwater. They appear to be able to do this by draining water from their nostrils, similar to turtles",
