        "Earth is the only planet whose English name does not derive from Greek or Roman mythology. The name of our planet comes from the Old English and Germanic languages. Many languages throughout the world have their own names for our planet. \n\n The surface of the Earth is very young – this means that the surface changed a lot from when it was first formed. Erosion and tectonic processes, like earthquakes, for example, destroy, recreate, and reshape most of Earth’s surface. \n\n One day on Earth, or the period in which the planet rotates once on its axis, is 23.9 hours. One Earth year or the period it takes for a celestial body to orbit the Sun once, takes about 365,25 days.Because of these numbers, we add one day on our calendars every 4 years to maintain their consistency with the planet’s orbit. This is called a leap day. \n\nEarth is the fifth largest planet in the Solar System. It has a diameter of 6.371 km / 3.958 mi. It is the largest terrestrial planet. In comparison, Mercury has about 38% of Earth’s diameter. As such, Earth is almost three times bigger. ",

        "Mercury is named after the Roman god of commerce, travel, and thievery. In Greek mythology, Mercury was known as Hermes, the messenger of the gods. It probably received this name because it moves very quickly across the sky. Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest planet to the Sun. Though it is very close to the Sun, it is not the hottest planet, that title belongs to Venus, but Mercury is the second-hottest nonetheless. \n\n Mercury is slightly bigger than Earth’s Moon, and it is also very similar in appearance to our Moon. Mercury itself doesn’t have any moons. The planet can be seen without binoculars or telescopes, but since it is so near to the Sun, it may be hard to see in the early evening skies.\n\n Mercury is covered with craters from various impacts. One of the largest is called the Caloris Basin, and it is 1.300 kilometers / 807 miles across. We know that Mercury is the smallest planet. It has a radius of 2.439 km / 1.516 mi and a diameter of 4.879 km / 3.032 mi. But how does it compare to the other planets in the Solar System? Both Venus and Earth are around three times bigger than Mercury. Mars is only 30% bigger than Mercury but now let's take a look at the giants of the Solar System.",

        "The planet Venus is named after the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty. In Greek mythology, she is known as Aphrodite. The planet was named after this goddess because, for the ancient people, it shinned the brightest. In our Solar System, the planet closest to the Sun is Mercury. But even though it is the nearest, it isn’t the hottest planet. Venus is actually the hottest planet out of all the planets in the Solar System. Venus is a little smaller than Earth, but like our planet, it has mountains, volcanoes, and few craters that indicate a relatively young surface. Both worlds also have similar densities and chemical compositions. Venus is sometimes referred to as Earth’s sister since scientists believe that it once had large amounts of water; however, it boiled away due to high temperatures. \n\n Venus’s rotation is also very slow. One day on Venus is equal to 243 Earth days, and one year or one trip around the Sun takes 225 Earth days. This means that a day is longer than a year on Venus.On Venus, the Sun rises once every 117 Earth days, this means that the Sun rises twice each Venusian year. On Earth, the Sun rises and sets once each day. \n\nVenus has a radius of 6.051 kilometers / 3.760 miles and a diameter of 12.104 km / 7.521 mi. It is only slightly smaller than Earth. It is the sixth-largest planet in the Solar System and the second-largest terrestrial planet.",

        "Mars is named after the Roman god of war. For the Greeks, Mars was known as Ares. It was named after the god of war because of its red color. Mars is widely known as the Red planet. Its reddish appearance is caused by the presence of rusty iron in the ground. The name of the month March is derived from Mars.\n\nMars is visible to the naked eye, and as such, you can see it without the use of a telescope or binoculars. The Red planet is very similar to Earth, and scientists are trying to find out if life was present there.\n\nIn many ways, Mars can be considered Earth’s brother. It has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. There are many signs of ancient floods on the Red Planet, but now water mostly exists in icy dirt and thin clouds. There is evidence of liquid salty water in the ground, especially on hillsides. This may be great if people will go there in the future, but observations continue.\n\n A day on Mars is a little longer than a day on Earth. It lasts about 24.6 hours. A year on Mars, however, or the time that takes for the Red Planet to circle our Sun, lasts about 687 Earth days or almost twice as long as a year on Earth.\n\n Mars is and the second-smallest planet of the Solar System after Mercury, having a diameter of 6.779 km / 4.212 mi. It is 30% bigger than Mercury and almost two times smaller than Earth and Venus. ",

It doesn’t have a true surface, but it may have a solid core about the size of Earth at its center.\n\n A day on Jupiter goes by very fast. It only lasts for about 10 hours. However, since it is farther away from the Sun than Earth, one year on Jupiter – the time it takes for it to circle the Sun once – is equal to 11.8 Earth years. \n\n Jupiter has a mean radius of 69.911 kilometers / 43.440 miles, a diameter at the equator of around 142.984 km / 88.846 mi, and a diameter at the poles of 133.708 km / 83.082 mi. It is the biggest planet in the Solar System. \n\n Compared to Earth, it has more than 11 times its diameter. Around 1.300 Earth’s would fit inside Jupiter’s volume. In comparison to Mercury, the smallest planet in the Solar System, it is more than 29 times its diameter. More than 24.462 Mercury’s would fit inside Jupiter’s volume.",
